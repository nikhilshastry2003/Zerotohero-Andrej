What we're building in Micrograd is basically a super simplified, digital version of just one of those brain cells (a neuron). It takes in some numbers (like signals), does a little math (its "thinking" part), and then gives us an output (its "decision").

Micrograd: Building a Micro-Autograd Engine (First Hour).

Our Big Idea (Right Now)
The main goal is to get how backpropagation actually works, deep down. We're building a tiny version of something like PyTorch's autograd from scratch. It's all about turning math stuff into these "computational graphs" and then, like, super efficiently figuring out all the gradients (aka, derivatives) through 'yhem. Pretty neat, huh?

What We've Done So Far (Step-by-Step, Kinda)
1. The Value Object: Our MVP (Most Valuable Piece)
What it is: Just a custom Python class that holds one single number. Simple.

Why we need it: Regular Python numbers are kinda dumb; they don't remember where they came from or what happened to 'em. Our Value object lets us make basic math (like adding, multiplying, or doing a tanh thing) not just spit out an answer, but also keep a little diary of what numbers went in (we call 'em "children") and what operation (_op) we did. That diary? That's our computational graph forming!

2. Drawing Out Our Math Adventures
What we did: Cooked up some cool helper functions (trace and draw_dot) using this graphviz library.

Why it's important: These functions are like our personal GPS for the math. You give 'em the final number (Value object), and they draw a whole map showing every single step and number that got us there. This "forward pass" visualization is clutch for seeing if our math journey makes sense and if data's flowing right.

3. Gradients & The Manual Backtrack (Ugh, But Necessary)
What we added: Every Value object now has a grad (short for gradient) attribute, which starts at 0.0.

Why it matters: This grad thing? That's where the real magic of backprop lives! It basically tells us, "Yo, if this number changes just a tiny bit, how much will the final answer freak out?"

The Manual Pain (Demonstration): We literally sat there, calculating and assigning these grad values by hand using the chain rule. For example, if o came from n.tanh(), then o.grad is 1.0 (duh, d(o)/d(o) is always 1). But to get n.grad, we had to do some calculus: d(o)/d(n) = (1 - tanh(n)^2). So, n.grad became o.grad * (1 - tanh(n)^2). It's a total drag for big stuff, but it really drills in how these gradients spread backward.

4. Building Our First Brain Cell (A Simple Neuron)
What we built: Just one tiny neuron. It's like the smallest Lego brick of a neural network.

How it works: We made our neuron's inputs (x1, x2), its "importance" numbers (weights w1, w2), and its little "boost" number (bias b) all into Value objects. Then, the neuron just does a simple calculation: it multiplies inputs by weights, adds the bias (x 
1
​
 w 
1
​
 +x 
2
​
 w 
2
​
 +b), and then squishes that number through a tanh function (that's the "activation" part).

Why it's cool: This shows how we can stack our Value objects to build more complicated math structures. It's the first step to making actual neural networks!

What's On Deck?
Right now, we're still manually doing all the gradient calculations. The next big thing is to make that whole backpropagation process automatic inside the Value class. That's gonna make it way easier to build bigger, crazier neural networks! Stay tuned!
