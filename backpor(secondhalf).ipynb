    "\"\"\"Understanding Automatic Differentiation: A Simple Micrograd Implementation\n",
    "This document explains a fundamental concept in machine learning and artificial intelligence: Automatic Differentiation (Autograd). This code provides a simplified, \"micro\" version of how powerful deep learning frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow calculate gradients, which are essential for training neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is Automatic Differentiation?\n",
    "Imagine you have a complex mathematical function, like the one that defines how a neural network makes a prediction. To \"train\" the network, you need to figure out how much each tiny adjustment to its internal settings (called \"weights\" and \"biases\") will affect the final prediction's error. This \"how much\" is precisely what a gradient tells you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic differentiation is a technique that automatically calculates these gradients. Instead of you manually deriving complex mathematical formulas for derivatives, the computer keeps track of all operations and then efficiently computes the gradients by working backward through the calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Core Building Block: The Value Object\n",
    "At the heart of this system is the Value class. Think of a Value object as a special container for a number. But it's more than just a number; it also keeps track of crucial information needed for automatic differentiation:\n",
    "\n",
    "data: This is the actual numerical value that the Value object holds (e.g., 2.0, -3.0).\n",
    "\n",
    "grad: This stands for \"gradient.\" It's a number that tells us how much the final output of our entire calculation is affected by a small change in this specific Value. Initially, it's 0.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "_prev: This is a set (a collection of unique items) of Value objects that were used as inputs to create this Value. For example, if c = a + b, then a and b would be in c._prev. This creates a \"computational graph\" – a record of how values depend on each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "_op: A string representing the operation that created this Value (e.g., '+', '*', 'tanh'). This is mainly for visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "label: A simple name you can give to a Value object for easier understanding and visualization (e.g., 'a', 'b', 'L').\n",
    "\n",
    "_backward: This is a special function associated with each Value object. When we perform an operation (like addition or multiplication), we also define how gradients should be passed backward through that specific operation. This function will be called during the backward pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building Blocks: Operations and Their Gradients\n",
    "The Value class overrides standard Python operations like + (addition) and * (multiplication), allowing you to perform arithmetic directly on Value objects. This means when you add two Value objects, Python uses our custom __add__ method instead of its default addition.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an operation like a + b happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "A new Value object is created to hold the result (a.data + b.data).\n",
    "\n",
    "This new Value object records a and b in its _prev set, linking them in the computational graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most importantly, it defines its own _backward function. This function contains the specific rules for how the gradient flowing into this result should be distributed back to its inputs (a and b). For addition, the gradient simply passes through (multiplied by 1.0). For multiplication, it's a bit more complex (e.g., if out = a * b, then a.grad gets b.data * out.grad, and b.grad gets a.data * out.grad).\n",
    "\n",
    "The tanh function is an example of an \"activation function\" often used in neural networks. It squashes any input number into a range between -1 and 1. It also defines its specific _backward rule based on the derivative of the tanh function.\n",
    "\n",
    "New Operations in Value\n",
    "The updated Value class includes more operations, making it more versatile:\n",
    "\n",
    "__pow__(self, other): Handles exponentiation (e.g., x**2). It ensures that only integer or float powers are supported for simplicity. Its _backward function correctly applies the power rule of differentiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "__rmul__(self, other): This allows for reverse multiplication (e.g., 2 * x where 2 is a regular number and x is a Value object). It simply calls self * other.\n",
    "\n",
    "__truediv__(self, other): Implements division (e.g., x / y). It cleverly reuses the multiplication and power operations by treating division as self * other**-1.\n",
    "\n",
    "__neg__(self): Handles negation (e.g., -x). It treats this as multiplication by -1 (self * -1).\n",
    "\n",
    "__sub__(self, other): Implements subtraction (e.g., x - y). It reuses addition and negation by treating it as self + (-other).\n",
    "\n",
    "__radd__(self, other): Allows for reverse addition (e.g., 2 + x). It simply calls self + other.\n",
    "\n",
    "exp(self): Implements the exponential function (e \n",
    "x\n",
    " ). Its _backward function correctly applies the derivative rule for e \n",
    "x\n",
    " , which is e \n",
    "x\n",
    "  itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "These additional methods make the Value class more robust, allowing you to build more complex mathematical expressions and automatically compute their gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Magic: The backward() Method for Gradient Calculation\n",
    "This is the core of automatic differentiation! When you call some_value.backward(), it does two main things:\n",
    "\n",
    "Builds a Topological Order (build_topo): It first figures out the correct order to process all the Value objects in the computational graph. It starts from the some_value (the final output) and traces back all its dependencies, ensuring that a Value is processed only after all the Value objects that depend on it have been processed. This ordered list is called a \"topological sort.\"\n",

    "Propagates Gradients:\n",
    "\n",
    "It initializes the grad of the some_value (the final output) to 1.0. This is because we are asking \"how much does the final output change with respect to itself?\" The answer is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, it iterates through the Value objects in the topo list in reverse order (from the final output back to the initial inputs).\n",
    "\n",
    "For each Value object, it calls its specific _backward() function. This function then adds its share of the gradient to its parent Value objects (_prev). This process continues, effectively \"back-propagating\" the gradient through the entire graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "After backward() completes, every Value object in the graph will have its grad attribute filled with the correct derivative, telling you how much that specific value contributes to the final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizing the Graph (draw_dot)\n",
    "The draw_dot function uses a library called graphviz to draw a visual representation of your computational graph. This is incredibly helpful for understanding how values are connected and how gradients flow. Each node in the graph shows:\n",

    "Its label (if provided)\n",
    "\n",
    "Its data value\n",

    "Its calculated grad value (after backward() has been called)\n",
    "Operations like +, *, tanh are also shown as separate nodes, connecting inputs to their results.\n",

    "Building a Neural Network: Neuron, Layer, and MLP\n",
    "The provided code also introduces classes to build a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), a fundamental type of neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neuron Class:\n",
    "\n",
    "A Neuron is the basic computational unit of a neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has a set of weights (w) and a bias (b). These are the adjustable parameters that the network \"learns.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The __call__ method defines how the neuron processes input x: it calculates a weighted sum of inputs (wi*xi for each input xi and its corresponding weight wi), adds the bias (b), and then applies a non-linear activation function (here, tanh). The result is the neuron's output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameters() method returns all the Value objects (weights and bias) within this neuron, which are the parameters we need to optimize during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Layer Class:\n",
    "\n",
    "A Layer is a collection of Neuron objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes an input of a certain size (nin) and produces an output of another size (nout), where nout is the number of neurons in the layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its __call__ method simply passes the input x through each neuron in the layer, collecting their outputs. If there's only one neuron, it returns its output directly; otherwise, it returns a list of outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its parameters() method collects all parameters from all neurons within that layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) Class:\n",
    "\n",
    "An MLP is a sequence of Layer objects, forming the complete neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes an input size (nin) and a list of output sizes for each hidden layer (nouts).\n",
    "\n",
    "Its __call__ method processes the input x sequentially through each layer. The output of one layer becomes the input for the next, until the final output of the network is produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its parameters() method collects all parameters from all layers in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training a Neural Network\n",
    "The final part of the code demonstrates a basic training loop for the MLP. The goal of training is to adjust the network's parameters (weights and biases) so that its predictions (ypred) are as close as possible to the desired target values (ys).\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Preparation:\n",
    "\n",
    "xs: A list of input data samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "ys: A list of corresponding desired target outputs for each input sample.\n",

    "Forward Pass:\n",

    "ypred = [n(x) for x in xs]: For each input sample x in xs, the MLP (n) makes a prediction, resulting in a list of ypred Value objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "loss = sum((yout - ygt)**2 for ygt, yout in zip(ys, ypred)): A loss function is calculated. Here, it's the mean squared error (MSE). For each prediction yout and its corresponding true target ygt, the squared difference is calculated, and all these squared differences are summed up. The loss is a single Value object representing how \"wrong\" the network's current predictions are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Backward Pass:\n",
    "\n",
    "for p in n.parameters(): p.grad = 0.0: Before computing new gradients, all existing gradients for the network's parameters are reset to zero. This is crucial because _backward functions add to grad, so we need a clean slate for each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "loss.backward(): This is where the magic happens! The backward() method is called on the loss Value object. This triggers the automatic differentiation process, propagating gradients all the way back through the MLP (through tanh, +, * operations in neurons and layers) to compute the gradient for every single weight and bias in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Update Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "for p in n.parameters(): p.data += -0.1 * p.grad: This is the optimization step. Each parameter's data is updated. We move its value in the direction opposite to its gradient (hence the -0.1 * p.grad).\n",
    "\n",
    "0.1 is the learning rate, a small number that controls how big of a step we take in the direction of the gradient. A positive gradient means increasing the parameter would increase the loss, so we decrease the parameter. A negative gradient means decreasing the parameter would increase the loss, so we increase the parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Print Loss: print(k, loss.data): The current iteration number k and the value of the loss are printed. You'll observe that the loss.data generally decreases over iterations, indicating that the network is learning and its predictions are getting closer to the targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "This training loop demonstrates the full cycle of a neural network learning: making predictions, calculating error, finding out how to adjust parameters to reduce error, and then actually adjusting them. This iterative process is how deep learning models are trained to perform complex tasks.\"\"\""
